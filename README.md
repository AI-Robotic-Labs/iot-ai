# Smart Factory Automation ðŸ¤–

This project is a **smart factory automation system** that uses **IoT**, **AI**, and **robotics** to improve manufacturing processes. Here's how it works:

## Overview

1. **Data Collection**: We use **IoT sensors** placed around the factory to monitor important information, such as:
   - Temperature
   - Vibration levels
   - Machine speed

2. **Data Analysis**: The collected data is sent to an **AI system** that analyzes it to look for any unusual patterns. For example, if the temperature of a machine gets too high, it might indicate a problem.

3. **Robot Control**: If the AI detects an issue, it sends commands to **robots** on the factory floor. For example, it might tell a robot to stop a machine or replace a faulty part.

4. **Real-Time Operation**: The system runs continuously, collecting data and responding to any issues in real time, which helps prevent machine breakdowns and improves overall efficiency.

## How to Use

1. **Build the Project**: Use `cargo build` to install the necessary tools and compile the code. It is necessary have Rust installed.
2. **Run the System**: Start the program, and it will begin collecting data from the IoT sensors and controlling the robots based on the AI analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: The programming language used to build the system.
- **Tokio**: A library for handling asynchronous tasks.
- **Serde**: A library for processing data.
- **R2R**: A library for robot control (you can replace this with the specific library you are using).
